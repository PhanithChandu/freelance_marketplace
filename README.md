## Overview

DAA Arcade turns abstract algorithm concepts into interactive, visual experiences. Each game module targets a core topic from Design & Analysis of Algorithms — graph traversal, dynamic programming, greedy methods, backtracking, and more — and visualises how the algorithm thinks its way to a solution.

No API keys. No backend. Just run it locally and start learning.

## Games & Algorithms

### 🗺️ Shortest Path Maze — Dijkstra's Algorithm
`src/games/Pathfinding.tsx` · `src/logic/shortestPath.ts`

Build or modify a maze with weighted terrain and watch Dijkstra's algorithm compute the optimal path from source to destination in real time. Demonstrates greedy shortest-path selection and priority queue mechanics.

---

### 🎒 Knapsack Ops — 0/1 Knapsack (Dynamic Programming)
`src/games/Knapsack.tsx` · `src/logic/knapsack.ts`

Choose items with different weights and values, set a capacity limit, and visualise the dynamic programming table being filled row by row. Understand how optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems lead to the best selection.

---

### ⚔️ Sorting Warriors — Sorting Algorithms & Complexity
`src/games/Sorting.tsx` · `src/logic/sorting.ts`

Compare sorting strategies side by side — Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and more — as they operate on the same input array. Builds intuition for time complexity differences through direct visual comparison.

---

### 🌐 Prime Network — Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's Algorithm)
`src/games/MST.tsx` · `src/logic/mst.ts`

Connect a set of nodes at the minimum possible total edge cost. Watch Prim's algorithm grow the spanning tree one edge at a time, illustrating greedy selection and the cut property of MSTs.

---

### 📡 Huffman Morse — Huffman Coding (Greedy)
`src/games/Huffman.tsx` · `src/logic/huffman.ts`

Enter a string and watch a Huffman tree get built from the character frequency table. Observe how the greedy merging of least-frequent nodes produces an optimal prefix-free code and compresses the input.

---

### 👑 The N-Queens Defense — Backtracking
`src/games/NQueens.tsx` · `src/logic/nqueens.ts`

Place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. The visualiser steps through every placement attempt and backtrack, making the search tree and constraint propagation tangible.

The architecture keeps algorithm logic strictly separated from the UI layer — `src/logic/` contains pure TypeScript functions with no React dependencies, making them independently testable and reusable.

## Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| React + TypeScript | Component UI and type-safe algorithm logic |
| Vite | Fast dev server and optimised production bundler |
| Tailwind CSS | Utility-first styling |
| Motion | Step-by-step algorithm animations |
| Lucide React | Icon set |

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** — current LTS version recommended ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org))

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PhanithChandu/DAA-ARCADE.git
cd DAA-ARCADE

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

> No API keys or environment variables are required. The app runs entirely client-side.

---

## Build & Preview

```bash
# Create an optimised production build
npm run build

# Serve the production build locally to verify it
npm run preview
```

The `dist/` folder contains the production-ready static output, deployable to any static host — Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.

| Sorting Warriors | Bubble / Quick Sort | Comparison-based | O(n²) / O(n log n) avg |
| Prime Network | Prim's MST | Greedy | O(E log V) |
| Huffman Morse | Huffman Coding | Greedy | O(n log n) |

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — new algorithm modules, improved visualisations, or bug fixes.

```bash
# Fork the repo and create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-algorithm-game

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "feat: add Floyd-Warshall all-pairs shortest path game"

# Push and open a pull request
git push origin feature/new-algorithm-game
```

**Guidelines for new modules:**
- Add algorithm logic to `src/logic/yourAlgorithm.ts` as a pure TypeScript function — no React imports
- Add the React visualisation to `src/games/YourGame.tsx`
- Register the new game in the main menu
